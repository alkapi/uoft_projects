To run the Terrible Drawing Program in Linux:
	1. Run the server by entering 
		tgdpserver <portnum>
	where <portnum> is replaced by a number larger than 1024
	
	2. Run the client by entering 
		xter localhost <portnum>
	where <portnum> is the same number given as the argument 
	to tgdpserver
	
	3. The Terrible Drawing Program window pop-ups up which
	allows one or more clients to draw upon the window and see 
	the effects of other clients' draw commands connected via
	the same port number
